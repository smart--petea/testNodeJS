Taking their name from a British phrase referring to an ironic or paradoxical situation or event, their brand of apocalyptic post punk and fiercely intense live shows fast established them as one of the most original bands to emerge from the UK in the late 70\u2019s. Fronted by self confessed misanthropist Jaz Coleman, his influence, along with guitarist Geordie and bass players Youth and later Raven, can be found in bands such as Metallica, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Therapy?, Nirvana and many more. <P>Killing Joke - XXV Gathering: The Band That Preys Together Stays Together was filmed on their sold out 25th Anniversary show at the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire in London and captures the band at their very best. Singer Coleman\u2019s intense stage presence is unmatchable still after all these years while the titanic guitar sound of Geordie is awe-inspiring. Tracks like War Dance,Wait, Psyche and Song and Dance seem more relevant now than the day they were written, while opening track Communion is mesmerizing.

It begins with the most obvious and effective Joy Division material: \"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\" \"She's Lost Control,\" \"Isolation,\" and \"New Dawn Fades.\" Of these, \"Isolation\" might work best, since its tension is made even more palpable by the insistent, screeching violins. The set moves into its second half with a stirring and methodically slow version of \"Bizarre Love Triangle.\" The cello, violins, and viola don't do as well with \"Blue Monday,\" but \"True Faith\" becomes the record's high point with its robust bottom end and plaintive melody. ~ Johnny Loftus, Rovi",
